# School-Management-System-in-Python
In this Project [School Management System in Python](https://getprojects.org/create-school-management-system-in-python/), we will build a GUI-based School Management System using the Tkinter, SQLite3, and TkCalender libraries and messagebox and Ttk modules of the Tkinter library. It is an intermediate level project, where you will learn how to use databases and make some great GUIs in Python and apply them in real life. Let’s start!

# About School Management System
School Management Systems manage all the information of the students and/or faculty in a particular school.

In our project, we will only use it to manage some basic personal information of the students of a school.

# About the project:
The objective of this is to create a GUI based School Management System. To build this, you will need intermediate understanding of Tkinter library and SQLite API and basic understanding of TkCalender, Datetime libraries, messagebox and Ttk modules.

# Project Prerequisites:
To build this project, we will need the following libraries:

1. Tkinter – To create the GUI.
2. SQLite3 – To connect the program to the database and store information in it.
3. TkCalender – To get the user to enter a date.
4. Datetime.date – To convert the date from the tree to a Datetime.date instance so that it can be set in.
5. Tkinter.messagebox – To show a display box, displaying some information or an error.
6. Tkinter.ttk – To create the tree where all the information will be displayed.
